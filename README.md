==========

Though this board has a great single player mode, If you build two, and bond them together digitally you then send one to a friend or loved one so you that you can play chess together over the internet with real chess pieces and only a few seconds of delay. Itâ€™s a great way to share some time and to connect with people who are physically distant.

Here are a few more features:

Check your moves are legal and warn you when you don't play by the rules
Suggest what would be a good next move for you
Entirely 3D printable including the chess pieces
Very cool looking LED lighting to convey the game status and provide the lighting for evening games
Smart control panel which guides you through how to use the board with intelligent backlighting
Small and low cost OLED screen to help guide you through using it
Powered by USB, so you can connect it to mains or run it from a common USB battery pack for untethered play

The internet connectivity, computer opponent and rule checking are handled by a Raspberry Pi, whilst the lighting and buttons are taken care of by an Arduino Nano.
